# Risk Prediction Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on Risk Prediction Analysis using a dataset related to taxable income. The objective is to predict taxable income categories ('Risky' or 'Good') based on various features. The dataset includes columns such as Undergrad, Marital Status, Taxable Income, City Population, Work Experience, and Urban.

## RandomForest Classifier

### Overview

The **RandomForest Classifier** is a versatile ensemble learning algorithm widely used for both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a multitude of decision trees and merges them to achieve more accurate and stable predictions.

### Significance

Random Forests offer several advantages:

- **High Accuracy:** By aggregating predictions from multiple trees, Random Forests often provide higher accuracy compared to individual decision trees.

- **Reduction of Overfitting:** The ensemble nature helps reduce overfitting, making the model more robust.

- **Feature Importance:** Random Forests can assess the importance of different features, aiding in understanding the key contributors to predictions.

- **Versatility:** Suitable for various types of data and tasks, making it a popular choice in machine learning applications.

### Use Cases

Random Forests find applications in diverse domains:

- **Finance:** Used for credit scoring and fraud detection due to their accuracy and ability to handle complex data.

- **Healthcare:** Applied in disease prediction models where interpreting feature importance is crucial for medical insights.

- **Marketing:** Utilized for customer segmentation and targeting in marketing strategies.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

#### 1.1 Importing Necessary Packages and Extracting Data

The project started by importing essential Python packages and extracting the dataset.

#### 1.2 Categorizing Taxable Income

Taxable Income was categorized into 'Risky' and 'Good' based on a condition: if taxable income is less than or equal to 30000, it was labeled as 'Risky'; otherwise, it was labeled as 'Good'. This becomes the target variable 'y'.

#### 1.3 Feature Engineering

The dataset was split into features (X) and the target variable (y). Mapping was applied to 'Undergrad' and 'Urban' columns, and one-hot encoding (get_dummies) was used for 'Marital Status' and 'Taxable Income' columns.

#### 1.4 Handling Missing Values

No missing values were found in the dataset, ensuring data integrity for analysis.

### 2. Modeling

#### 2.1 RandomForest Classifier

The RandomForest Classifier was chosen for modeling. The features ['Undergrad', 'Work Experience', 'Urban', 'Divorced', 'Married', 'Single'] were selected as X variables, and 'Risky' was set as the y variable.

#### 2.2 Data Scaling

Data scaling was performed using Standard Scaler to standardize the feature values.

#### 2.3 Model Fitting and Prediction

The dataset was fitted into the RandomForest Classifier, and predictions were made. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.50%.

## Conclusion

The project successfully analyzed the dataset to predict taxable income categories using a RandomForest Classifier. Through careful preprocessing and feature engineering, the model achieved an accuracy of 87.50%.

## Future Work

Future work may involve refining feature engineering, exploring alternative models, and incorporating additional variables to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model.
